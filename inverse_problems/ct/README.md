# Data

## Downloads
We use the same data as [link](https://github.com/Subhadip-1/data_driven_convex_regularization/):
The phantoms are available (as .npy files) here: [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SHN-yti3MgLmmW_l0agZRzMVtp0kx6dD?usp=sharing). Download the .zip file containing the phantoms, unzip, and put inside the cloned directory.

## Preprocessing
To generate the validation and test sets run
```
python make_data_sets.py
```
